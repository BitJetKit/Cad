CAD for laser cutters and 3D printers

#   Laser Cutting #
We do laser cutting using Trotec Speedy 100 laser cutter, typically on 3mm acrylic. 
We make the designs in CorelDraw (expencive) or Inkscape(open source) - both are suitable but CorelDraw works better. Using the laser cutter requires Trotec job Control. 

#   3D Printing#
We use Autodesk Inventor 2015 to design the parts and Ultimaker 2+ to produce prototypes and verify the designs. It requires Cura 3D pritning software. The designs were tested at Barclays labs, only using PLA. Many of these designs have a lot of support structures, due to complex shapes and large overhangs. 
The intention is for these designs to be produced in batches on industrial SLA machines - we would simply order them from a third party.
